        United Nations (UN) Sustainability Goal and/or National Academy of Engineers (NAE) Grand Challenge. Throughout
        the program, students focus on NYU Tandon's key areas of excellence including Cybersecurity, Data Science, Urban
        Sustainability, and Emerging Media. Additionally, all students are required to complete 12 components of
        the 5 GLASS windows, focusing on topics such as Global Competency, Commitment to Service, Leadership
